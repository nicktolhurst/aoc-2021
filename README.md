# Advent of Code 2021!

Behold the code behind my participation of [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/). 

My plan is to write each day in a different programming language, though I suspect this statement will quickly be lost to the git history :eyes:!

- [Day 1 - Python](https://github.com/nicktolhurst/aoc-2021/tree/main/day-one)
- [Day 2 - Go](https://github.com/nicktolhurst/aoc-2021/tree/main/day-two)
    - [Day 2 - Batch](https://github.com/nicktolhurst/aoc-2021/tree/main/day-one-batch)
- [Day 3 - c#](https://github.com/nicktolhurst/aoc-2021/tree/main/day-three)
